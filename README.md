# theme-mashing
A repository where I mash parts of themes that I think would go well, all of them will have credits.
# ⚙️ How It Works 
I simply just upload whatever themes I like that are usable in [Revenge!](https://github.com/revenge-mod)

Whatever changes I actually have put in them will be noted (if I figure out how to do that)!
